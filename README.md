# Genetic-Algorithm-Binary-Backpack-Matlab
Contain cull, crossover, and mutation like usual. Also contain "King Selection(KS)" to improve performance.
I have referred to "HowardGoldowsky/Genetic_Algorithm_for_Backpack", modified some irrational places, and added KS.
GeneticBackpack.m uses Genetic Algorithm.
MatlabBackpack.mlx uses matlab function "intlinprog".
